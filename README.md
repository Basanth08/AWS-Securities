## üîí **Security Note**

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** I have intentionally not uploaded any screenshots or images from my actual AWS account due to security concerns. While I could have included visual documentation of my implementations, I prioritized protecting sensitive information such as:
> - Account IDs and resource identifiers
> - Network configurations and IP addresses
> - Security group rules and access patterns
> - IAM user details and permission structures
> - VPC configurations and routing tables
> - CloudTrail logs and monitoring data
> - Cost and billing information
> - Resource naming conventions that could reveal infrastructure details

> **üõ°Ô∏è Security First Approach:** This decision reflects my commitment to security best practices. Even in a learning environment, I believe in maintaining strict security hygiene and not exposing any information that could potentially be used maliciously or reveal details about my infrastructure architecture.

> **üìö Documentation Focus:** Instead of screenshots, I've focused on providing comprehensive textual documentation that demonstrates my understanding and implementation of AWS security concepts, best practices, and architectural decisions.
